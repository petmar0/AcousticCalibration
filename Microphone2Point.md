# Simple Two-Point Microphone Characterization

## Tools
- Microphone Calibrator
- Computer with Audacity, Raven, Praat, or other audio software

## Procedure
1. Place microphone of DUT in the front of the microphone calibrator
2. Start recording on DUT
3. Set microphone calibrator to 94 dB re 20 µPa
4. Wait a few seconds
5. Set microphone calibrator to 114 dB re 20 µPa
6. Wait a few seconds
7. Turn off microphone calibrator
8. Stop recording
9. Download sound file from DUT
10. Find the value of the 94 dB re 20 µPa tone in LSBs or U
11. Find the value of the 114 dB re 20 µPa tone in LSBs or U
12. Calculate the logarithmic sensitivity by dividing the ∆LSB or ∆U by the ∆SPL (20 dB re 20 µPa)
