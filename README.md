# Acoustic Calibration

Welcome! If you're interested in making certain that your recording gear is calibrated to get the proper measurement readings, you're in the right place!

## Definitions
- Calibration: the acts of characterizing a system, adjusting it, and then re-characterizing it until it meets a Specification.
- Characterization: measuring a Device Under Test (DUT) against a Standard, which itself it traceable to a National Standards Laboratory Standard and/or a BIPM Primary Standard.
- Adjustment: the changing of a DUT or its output data to reflect the difference between its characterization and its specified behavior.
- Specification: a set of parameters under which a device is supposed to work, such as its intrinsic uncertainties and linearity
